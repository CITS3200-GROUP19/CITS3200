Data Warehouse and Web Front-end for the Largest Visual Field Datasets in WA

Massive amount of visual field data have been collected in the past 20 years across WA eye clinics. These data hold the keys to understand different types of vision losses. Using visual field testing devices such as Humphery Machines, our eyes' vision responses are separated into discrete tile regioins for measurement. The loss of vision can be for example classified into Altitudinal, Arcuate, Partial Arcuate, Paracentral, Nasal Step, Temporal Wedge, and etc. See this picture for an illustration (https://jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/OPHTH/9906/ecs20164f1.png). Different types of vision loss will affect your visual perception, for example, certain type of loss will make one not suitable for driving.
In this project, you will work with a team of eye clinicians, surgeons and specialists in WA to design and build a data warehouse to store the visual field data of patients across WA, and develop a web interface as a prototype for meaningful exploratory data analysis. The impact of this work cannot be overstated. We are aiming for this project to compete for the prestigeous WAITTA 2020 submission.
