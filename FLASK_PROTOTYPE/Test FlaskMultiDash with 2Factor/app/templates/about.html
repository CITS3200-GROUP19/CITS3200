    		<h1> About Us </h1>
    		<h5 class="w3-padding-8 w3-text-black"> Our project team consists of six UWA students completing the CITS3200 unit. Each of us comes from a different computer science background, with a diverse range of skills in this area. We are working with eye clinicians and specialists around Western Australia, liased by Dr Wei Liu, our project supervisor. </h5>

    		<h1> The Project </h1>
    		<h5 class="w3-padding-8 w3-text-black"> In Western Australia, massive amounts of visual field data have been collected in the past 20 years across various eye clinics. This data holds the key to understanding the different types of visual losses and the possible associated trends.
			<br> </br>
    		This visual field data has been collected with devices such as Humphery Machines, which record discrete data points with respect to the patient's eye for measurement. Our project team has designed and built a data warehouse to store the visual field data and analyse the data through this web app. This will allow eye clinicians to utilise this interface, view visual loss trends and patient progress, in a holistic manner. </h5>
